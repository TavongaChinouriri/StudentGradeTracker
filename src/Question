Case Study: Student Grade Tracker

You have been tasked with creating a program to track and calculate grades
for a class of students. The system should be able to perform the following
operations:
1. Add a student:
 Each student has a unique ID, name, and a list of their scores on
different assignments.
 The system should allow the user to enter the details of a student
and add them to the class.
2. Display student information:
 The system should display the information for a specific student,
including their ID, name, and scores on assignments.
3. Calculate the average grade:
 The system should calculate the average grade for a specific
student based on their scores on assignments.
 The average grade should be displayed with a corresponding
letter grade (e.g., A, B, C) based on a grading scale.

You should create appropriate classes and methods to implement the student
grade tracker. Here's a suggested class structure:
1. Student class:
 Properties: ID, name, list of scores
 Methods: getters and setters for the properties,
calculateAverageGrade() to calculate the average grade
2. GradeTracker class:
 Properties: an ArrayList or another suitable data structure to store
the students
 Methods:
 addStudent(Student student): adds a student to the tracker
 displayStudentInformation(int studentId): displays the
information for a specific student
 calculateAverageGrade(int studentId): calculates the average
grade for a specific student

You can implement the Student Grade Tracker by creating the necessary
classes and implementing the methods mentioned above. Additionally, you
can add features such as calculating the class average, finding the student
with the highest grade, or searching for students by name.
Remember to handle input validation and provide appropriate error messages
when necessary.
